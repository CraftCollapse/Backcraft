## Getting Started

Backcraft is a desktop app backup tool for Windows, designed 
to help you make backups of your Minecraft folder, which includes in-game configuration files, launcher options, worlds, screenshots, resource packs and more.

Archives are copied, compressed and labeled easily for you to restore them if there were a problem with your files, plus there is a log file where you can see what and when is the backup being done.

The configuration is very simple, select what you want to backup, the interval between backups, proceed to save and voila!
